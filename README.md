# My Portfolio

## About Me
Hello, I am Marcus Rocco Fratarcangeli. I am a mechanical engineering thesis-track master from Georgia Tech with expertise in autonomous systems, additive manufacturing, and machine learning, demonstrated through a self-driving lab for photopolymer synthesis and testing. I am skilled in SolidWorks, Python, and automation, and I excel in designing innovative solutions and collaborating in cross-functional teams to advance technology in autonomous systems, defense, AI, or manufacturing. I developed strong leadership skills from being an executive in several undergraduate clubs and organizations, as well as being an ENGAGES program mentor and Eagle Scout. I enjoy balancing technical innovation with personal growth through powerlifting, reading, and spending quality time with my family.

## Projects
### Self-driving Lab (SDL)
During my time at Georgia Tech in the Active Materials and Additive Manufacturing laboratory, led by Dr. Jerry Qi, my thesis project was: "Self-driving lab of photopolymer synthesis and mechanical testing for expedited materials discovery." 
This work has developed three important components of SDLs for synthesizing and testing photopolymers. The first component prepares photopolymer inks using a robotic arm, closed-loop liquid dispensing system for monomers/crosslinkers, and powder dispenser for photoinitiators. The second component cures photopolymer inks with a custom rheological sensor to determine time, temperature, and speed of curing. The third and final component automatically performs tensile tests on tensile bars made from the previous photopolymer inks using a robotic arm, force sensor, and automated clamp for grasping the samples. Simultaneously, the tensile testing system utilizes cameras for anomaly detection with machine learning, and digital image correlation for detecting sample dimensions. There is also automated data processing and property extraction with an algorithm that calculates and stores material properties including modulus of elasticity, elongation, and tensile strength.

### QubeSat
My undergraduate senior design project in mechanical engineering was designing and fabricating a 3D printed CubeSat with an integrated thermal sensing apparatus. Given that this work was the first foray of Quinnipiac University into space engineering, the entire CubeSat was made from the ground up. I led a team of three other engineers to research CubeSats and review technical documentation, design components such as the frame or housing, electronic power supply system, and communications system with bespoke antenna array. The project was presented at the ASEE Zone I conference at Penn State University and earned an Award for Excellence.
