    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I am Marcus Rocco Fratarcangeli. I am a mechanical engineering thesis-track master from Georgia Tech with expertise in autonomous systems, additive manufacturing, and machine learning, demonstrated through a self-driving lab for photopolymer synthesis and testing. I am skilled in SolidWorks, Python, and automation, and I excel in designing innovative solutions and collaborating in cross-functional teams to advance technology in autonomous systems, defense, AI, or manufacturing. I developed strong leadership skills from being an executive in several undergraduate clubs and organizations, as well as being an ENGAGES program mentor and Eagle Scout. I enjoy balancing technical innovation with personal growth through powerlifting, reading, and spending quality time with my family.</p>
