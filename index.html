    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, I am Marcus Rocco Fratarcangeli. I am a mechanical engineering thesis-track master from Georgia Tech with expertise in autonomous systems, additive manufacturing, and machine learning, demonstrated through a self-driving lab for photopolymer synthesis and testing. I am skilled in SolidWorks, Python, and automation, and I excel in designing innovative solutions and collaborating in cross-functional teams to advance technology in autonomous systems, defense, AI, or manufacturing. I developed strong leadership skills from being an executive in several undergraduate clubs and organizations, as well as being an ENGAGES program mentor and Eagle Scout. I enjoy balancing technical innovation with personal growth through powerlifting, reading, and spending quality time with my family.</p>

      <h3>Self-driving Lab (SDL)</h3>
      <p>During my time at Georgia Tech in the Active Materials and Additive Manufacturing laboratory, led by Dr. Jerry Qi, my thesis project was: "Self-driving lab of photopolymer synthesis and mechanical testing for expedited materials discovery." This work developed three key components of SDLs for synthesizing and testing photopolymers:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Preparation of photopolymer inks using a robotic arm, closed-loop liquid dispensing system for monomers/crosslinkers, and powder dispenser for photoinitiators.</li>
        <li>Curing photopolymer inks with a custom rheological sensor to determine time, temperature, and speed of curing.</li>
        <li>Automated tensile testing on tensile bars using a robotic arm, force sensor, and automated clamp, with cameras for anomaly detection via machine learning and digital image correlation for sample dimensions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Automated data processing and property extraction calculated material properties like modulus of elasticity, elongation, and tensile strength. Active collaboration for the active learning aspect can be found <a href="https://github.com/ajain300/Autonomous-Thermoset-Discovery">here</a>.</p>

      <h3>QUbeSat</h3>
      <p>My undergraduate senior design project in mechanical engineering was designing and fabricating a 3D printed CubeSat with an integrated thermal sensing apparatus. As the first foray of Quinnipiac University into space engineering, the entire CubeSat was built from the ground up. I led a team of three other engineers to research CubeSats, review technical documentation, and design components such as the frame, electronic power supply system, and communications system with a bespoke antenna array. The project was presented at the ASEE Zone I conference at Penn State University and earned an Award for Excellence.</p>
